This reposiporty using the build tool
[Ceedling](http://www.throwtheswitch.org/ceedling) and the testing framework
[Unity](https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch/Unity). This is my prefered Embedded
C development stack.

The build tools run in Ruby, so you will have to have a [working version of Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) first.
Then you can run the ceedling command to execute the tests.

```./ceedling```
